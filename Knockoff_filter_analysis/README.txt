Within these four files there are a some examples of the statistical machine learning analysis carried out in R. Unfortunately,
the original datasets could not be used and so any loading has been replaced with '...'. The knockoff filter for variable selection
was implemented within which linear regression models were fit.

Fixed-X and Model-X are two types of knockoff filter.
KF - Elastic net used elastic net regression within the knockoff filter and
KF - Relaxed GLMnet is another regression fitting method,.
Graph creation - creates the figures used for the end report.
