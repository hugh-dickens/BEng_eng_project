Within these three files there are a few examples of the preprocessing data engineering that was required in R. Unfortunately,
the original datasets could not be used and so any loading has been replaced with '...'

buurt_2015 - the smallest dataset used
Coord - used for data interpretation, plotted all the EV charging points on a map of the Netherlands
shape_pop_cluster1_30 - a high performance computing cluster was used to analyse the datasets. This is an example batch of code
			which was then repeated for all remaining ~1800 charging points before being constructed back together.
